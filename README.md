## Abstract of the Talk

The next wave of AI breakthroughs is expected to emerge from the widespread adoption of AI-powered robotics. By transforming industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation, intelligent robots are set to catalyze innovation and streamline operations across numerous sectors.

This introductory course provides a concise overview of NVIDIA's robotics platform, designed to accelerate robotics development in this rapidly evolving field. Attendees will learn about leveraging NVIDIA Omniverse alongside OpenUSD to create high-fidelity digital twins for synthetic data generation and factory optimization. They will also be introduced to Isaac Sim, an advanced simulation tool that enables developers to build, test, and validate robotic applications in realistic, physics-accurate virtual environments. The session will also explore Isaac Lab, highlighting its role in training AI models through reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), enabling robots to perform complex tasks that traditional controllers struggle with. In addition, attendees will learn how to deploy robust robotic solutions using Isaac ROS, ROS2, and NVIDIA Jetson AGX, the world's most powerful embedded AI platform for robotics.

By the end of the session, attendees will have a high-level understanding of how NVIDIA's ecosystem supports robotics innovation, and how they can leverage these software and hardware tools for their own future projects.
