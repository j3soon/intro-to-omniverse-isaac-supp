## Abstract of the Talk

AI-powered robotics is expected to drive the next major wave of technological innovation. As intelligent robots become increasingly integrated into industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation, they are set to catalyze innovation and streamline operations across numerous sectors.

This talk offers a streamlined introduction to NVIDIA’s robotics platform, aimed at accelerating robotics development in today’s fast-changing landscape. Attendees will discover how to use NVIDIA Omniverse and OpenUSD to build high-fidelity digital twins for synthetic data generation and factory optimization. The session will cover Isaac Sim, a powerful simulation tool for building, testing, and validating robotic applications in realistic, physics-based virtual environments. We will also explore Isaac Lab, focusing on its capabilities for training AI models through reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), empowering robots to master complex tasks beyond the reach of traditional controllers. In addition, the talk will explain how to deploy robust robotic solutions with Isaac ROS, ROS2, and NVIDIA Jetson AGX - the leading embedded AI platform for robotics. Finally, we will introduce the latest SDKs, including Isaac GR00T, Cosmos, NVIDIA Warp, and Newton.

If time permits, attendees will be guided through a minimal Isaac Lab example demonstrating GPU-accelerated reinforcement learning, experiencing firsthand the benefits of GPU acceleration. The only requirement is a laptop with internet access.

By the end of the session, attendees will have a high-level understanding of how NVIDIA's ecosystem supports robotics innovation, and how they can leverage these software and hardware tools for their own future projects. A curated list of resources is provided for individuals interested in delving deeper into robotics.
